ICFP 2009 programs sources  by Team Ikoma (naoya_t)

Written in scheme, but very dirty code.

requires:
 1)  Gauche 0.8.13
     Scheme interpreter.
     Available in http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/
     Latest version is 0.8.14 but it doesn't work well with gauche-gl
     so we use older version 0.8.13.
     (Please tell me if you cannot get the version 0.8.13)

 2)  Gauche-gl

% gosh XXXX.scm
       gosh is Gauche interpreter command.
       XXXX is scenario number (1001-1004, 2001-2004, 3001-3004)

To let simulator move, hit space key on graphic screen.
We will hit space keys to progress the simulation until the score comes
then trace log XXXX.osf will be produced.

On some scenario, we will wait seconds to see the screen...
